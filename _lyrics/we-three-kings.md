title: We Three Kings
---


1. We three kings of Orient are  
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar.  
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,  
Following yonder star.

   O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to Thy perfect light.  

2. Born a King on Bethlehem plain,  
Gold I bring to crown Him again,  
King forever,  
Ceasing never  
Over us all to reign.  

   O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to Thy perfect light.  

3. Frankincense to offer have I;  
Incense owns a Deity nigh:  
Prayer and praising  
All men raising,  
Worship Him God on high.  

   O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to Thy perfect light.  

4. Myrrh is mine; it's bitter perfume;  
Breathes a life of gathering gloom:  
Sorrowing, sighing,  
Bleeding, dying,  
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.  

   O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to Thy perfect light.  

5. Glorious now behold Him arise,  
King and God and sacrifice.  
Heav'n sings  
Halleluia;  
Hallelujah the earth replies.  

   O star of wonder, star of night,  
Star with royal beauty bright,  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide us to Thy perfect light.
