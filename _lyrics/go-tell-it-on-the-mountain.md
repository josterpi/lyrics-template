title: Go, Tell It On The Mountain
---
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.

1. While shepherds kept their watching  
O'er silent flocks by night,  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  

   Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.  

2. The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed our Savior's birth;  

   Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.  

3. Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born;  
And God sent out salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn.  

   Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.  

4. When I was a seeker  
I sought both night and day  
I sought the Lord to help me  
And He showed me the way.  

   Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.

5. He made me a watchman  
Upon the city wall  
And If I am a Christian  
I am the least of all.

   Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born.
