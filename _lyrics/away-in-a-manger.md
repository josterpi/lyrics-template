title: Away in a Manger
---
1. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
The little Lord Jesus Laid down his sweet head:  
The stars in the heavens Look'd down where he lay,  
The little Lord Jesus Asleep in the hay.  

2. The cattle are lowing, The poor baby wakes,  
But little Lord Jesus No crying he makes;  
I love thee, Lord Jesus, Look down from the sky,  
And stay by my cradle Till morning is nigh.  

3. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever And love me, I pray:  
Bless all the dear children In thy tender care,  
And take us to heaven, To live with thee there.
